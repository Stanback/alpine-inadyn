# Inadyn Docker Image

This repository contains a Dockerfile for building a
lighweight Docker image with the [inadyn](http://troglobit.com/inadyn.html)
dynamic DNS client.

# Building

The simplest way to build the image is to clone this repository
and run the following:

```
docker build \
   --rm=true \
   --tag=inadyn \
   .
```

# Running

following (the scripts and cache directories are optional):

```
docker run \
   -d \
   -v $PWD/inadyn.conf:/etc/inadyn.conf \
   -v $PWD/scripts:/usr/share/inadyn \
   -v $PWD/cache:/var/cache/inadyn \
   --name=inadyn \
   --restart=always \
   inadyn
```

# Pre-built Image
